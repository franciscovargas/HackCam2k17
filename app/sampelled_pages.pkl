For the song by Trey Songz, see SmartPhones (song). Not to be confused with Feature phone. An array of various touchscreen smartphones. A person using a smartphone to take a digital photograph. A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use.[1][2][3] Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components ("apps" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate "app" features. In 1999, the Japanese firm NTT DoCoMo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country.[4] Smartphones became widespread in the late 2000s. Most of those produced from 2012 onward have high-speed mobile broadband 4G LTE, motion sensors, and mobile payment features. In the third quarter of 2012, one billion smartphones were in use worldwide.[5] Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for regular cell phones in early 2013.[6] Contents 1 History 1.1 Early years 1.2 Forerunner 1.3 PDAs 1.4 Mass adoption 1.5 Operating systems 1.6 2010s technological developments 1.7 Future possible developments 2 Hardware 2.1 Display 2.2 Accessories 3 Software 3.1 Mobile operating systems 3.1.1 Android 3.1.2 iOS 3.1.3 Windows 10 Mobile 3.1.4 Tizen 3.1.5 Sailfish OS 3.1.6 Ubuntu Touch 3.1.7 Discontinued operating systems 3.1.7.1 BlackBerry 10 3.1.7.2 BlackBerry OS 3.1.7.3 Windows Mobile 3.1.7.4 Symbian 3.1.7.5 Firefox OS 3.1.7.6 Bada 3.1.7.7 webOS 3.1.7.8 Palm OS 3.1.7.9 MeeGo/Maemo/Moblin 3.2 Mobile app 3.3 Application stores 4 Sales 4.1 By manufacturer 4.2 By operating system 5 Use 5.1 Social 5.2 While driving 5.3 Legal 5.4 Medical 5.5 Security 5.6 Sleep 6 Comparison with feature phones 6.1 Battery 7 Terminology 8 See also 9 Notes and references History[edit] Early years[edit] The first caller identification receiver (1971). Devices that combined telephony and computing were first conceptualized by Nikola Tesla in 1909 and Theodore Paraskevakos in 1971 and patented in 1974, and were offered for sale beginning in 1993. Paraskevakos was the first to introduce the concepts of intelligence, data processing and visual display screens into telephones. In 1971, while he was working with Boeing in Huntsville, Alabama, Paraskevakos demonstrated a transmitter and receiver that provided additional ways to communicate with remote equipment, however it did not yet have general purpose PDA applications in a wireless device typical of smartphones. They were installed at Peoples\' Telephone Company in Leesburg, Alabama and were demonstrated to several telephone companies. The original and historic working models are still in the possession of Paraskevakos.[7] Forerunner[edit] IBM Simon and charging base (1994).[8] The first mobile phone to incorporate PDA features was a prototype developed by Frank Canova[9] in 1992 while at IBM and demonstrated that year at the COMDEX computer industry trade show. It included PDA features and other visionary mobile applications such as maps, stock reports and news. A refined version was marketed to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator. The Simon was the first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a "smartphone", although it was not called that in 1994.[9][10][11] In addition to placing and receiving cellular calls, Simon could send and receive faxes and emails and included an address book, calendar, appointment scheduler, calculator, world time clock and notepad, utilizing its touch screen display.[12] The term "smart phone" appeared in print as early as 1995, describing AT&T\'s PhoneWriter Communicator.[13][non-primary source needed] PDAs[edit] Main article: Personal digital assistant In the mid-late 1990s, many mobile phone users carried a separate dedicated PDA device, running early versions of operating systems such as Palm OS, BlackBerry OS or Windows CE/Pocket PC.[1] These operating systems would later evolve into mobile operating systems. In March 1996, Hewlett-Packard released the OmniGo 700LX, a modified HP 200LX palmtop PC that supported a Nokia 2110 phone with ROM-based software to support it. It had a 640 200 resolution CGA compatible four-shade gray-scale LCD screen and could be used to place and receive calls, and to create and receive text messages, emails and faxes. It was also 100% DOS 5.0 compatible, allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles, including early versions of Windows. In August 1996, Nokia released the Nokia 9000 Communicator, a digital cellular phone based on the Nokia 2110 with an integrated PDA based on the PEN/GEOS 3.0 operating system from Geoworks. The two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design, with the display above and a physical QWERTY keyboard below. The PDA provided e-mail; calendar, address book, calculator and notebook applications; text-based Web browsing; and could send and receive faxes. When closed, the device could be used as a digital cellular phone. In June 1999 Qualcomm released the "pdQ Smartphone", a CDMA digital PCS Smartphone with an integrated Palm PDA and Internet connectivity.[14] Subsequent landmark devices included: The Ericsson R380 (2000) by Ericsson Mobile Communications.[15] The first device marketed as a "smartphone",[16] it combined the functions of a mobile phone and PDA, and supported limited Web browsing with a resistive touchscreen utilizing a stylus.[17] The Kyocera 6035 (early 2001) introduced by Palm, Inc. Combining a PDA with a mobile phone, it operated on the Verizon network, and supported limited Web browsing.[18][19] Handspring\'s Treo 180 (2002), the first smartphone to combine the Palm OS and a GSM phone with telephony, SMS messaging and Internet access fully integrated into the OS.[20] Smartphones before present-day Android-, iOS- and BlackBerry-based phones typically used the Symbian operating system. Originally developed by Psion, it was the world\'s most widely used smartphone operating system until the last quarter of 2010.[citation needed] Mass adoption[edit] In 1999, the Japanese firm NTT DoCoMo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country. These phones ran on i-mode, which provided data transmission speeds up to 9.6 kbit/s.[21] Unlike future generations of wireless services, NTT DoCoMo\'s i-mode used cHTML, a language which restricted some aspects of traditional HTML in favor of increasing data speed for the devices. Limited functionality, small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available.[22] The rise of i-mode helped NTT DoCoMo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001. It was also ranked first in market capitalization in Japan and second globally. This power would wane in the face of the rise of 3G and new phones with advanced wireless network capabilities.[23] Outside Japan smartphones were still rare until the introduction of the Danger Hiptop in 2002, which saw moderate success in the US as the T-Mobile Sidekick. Later, in the mid-2000s, devices based on Microsoft\'s Windows Mobile started to gain popularity among business users in the U.S. The BlackBerry later gained mass adoption in the U.S., and American users popularized the term "CrackBerry" in 2006 due to its addictive nature.[24] The company first released its GSM BlackBerry 6210, BlackBerry 6220, and BlackBerry 6230 devices in 2003.[25] Operating systems[edit] Symbian was the most popular smartphone OS in Europe during the middle to late 2000s. Initially, Nokia\'s Symbian devices were focused on business, similar to Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices at the time. From 2006 onwards, Nokia started producing entertainment-focused smartphones, popularized by the Nseries. In Asia, with the exception of Japan, the trend was similar to that of Europe.[citation needed] In 2003, Motorola launched the first smartphone to use Linux, the A760 handset.[26] While the initial release was limited to a single high-end handset only available in the Asia-Pacific region, the maker\'s intention was to eventually use Linux on most of its handsets, including the lower-end models. Further models to use Linux such as the Motorola Ming A1200i in 2005 and several successors to the Ming line would be unveiled through 2010. In late 2009, Motorola released the Motorola Cliq,[27] the first of Motorola\'s smartphones to run the Linux-based Android operating system. In early 2007, Apple Inc. introduced the iPhone, one of the first smartphones to use a multi-touch interface. The iPhone was notable for its use of a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction, instead of a stylus, keyboard, or keypad typical for smartphones at the time.[28] In October 2008, the first phone to use Android called the HTC Dream (also known as the T-Mobile G1) was released.[29][30] Android is an open-source platform founded by Andy Rubin and now owned by Google.[31][32] Although Android\'s adoption was relatively slow at first, it started to gain widespread popularity in 2010, and in early 2012 dominated the smartphone market share worldwide, which continues to this day.[33] These new platforms led to the decline of earlier ones. Microsoft, for instance, started a new OS from scratch, called Windows Phone. Nokia abandoned Symbian and partnered with Microsoft to use Windows Phone on its smartphones. Windows Phone then became the third-most-popular OS. Palm\'s webOS was bought by Hewlett-Packard and later sold to LG Electronics for use on LG smart TVs. BlackBerry Limited, formerly known as Research In Motion, also made a new platform based on QNX, BlackBerry 10, which was later discontinued. The capacitive touchscreen also changed smartphone form factors. Before 2007, it was common for devices to have a physical numeric keypad or physical QWERTY keyboard in either a candybar or sliding form factor. However, by mid 2010s, almost all smartphones were touchscreen phones. 2010s technological developments[edit] Smartphones running Android OS In 2013, the Fairphone company launched its first "socially ethical" smartphone at the London Design Festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing.[34] In late 2013, QSAlpha commenced production of a smartphone designed entirely around security, encryption and identity protection.[35] In December 2013, the world\'s first curved OLED technology smartphones were introduced to the retail market with the sale of the Samsung Galaxy Round and LG G Flex models.[36] Samsung phones with more bends and folds in the screens were expected in 2014.[37] In 2013, water- and dustproofing made their way into mainstream high end smartphones including the Sony Xperia Z, Sony Xperia Z3 and Samsung Galaxy S5.[38] Previously, this feature was confined to special ruggedized phones designed for outdoor use. In early 2014, smartphones were beginning to use Quad HD (2K) 2560x1440 on 5.5" screens with up to 534 PPI on devices such as the LG G3 which is a significant improvement over Apple\'s Retina Display. Quad HD is used in advanced televisions and computer monitors, but with 110 PPI or less on such larger displays.[39] In 2014, Wi-Fi networks were used a lot for smartphones. As Wi-Fi became more prevalent and easier to connect to, it was predicted that Wi-Fi phone services will start to take off.[40][41][42] In 2014, LG introduced lasers on the LG G3 to help camera focus.[43] In 2014, some smartphones had such good digital cameras that they could be categorized as high-end point-and-shoot cameras with large sensors up to 1" with 20 megapixels and 4K video. Some can store their pictures in proprietary raw image format, but the Android (operating system) 5.0 Lollipop serves open source RAW images.[44][45] By 2015, smartphones were increasingly integrated with everyday uses. For instance, credit cards, mobile payments, and mobile banking were integrated into smartphone applications and Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms.[46] Additionally, recent technological innovations are causing the role of traditional keys to be fused into the smartphones, because a smartphone can act as a digital key and access badge for its users.[47] In October 2015, Microsoft announced Windows Continuum, a feature that allows users to connect their devices to an external monitor via Microsoft Continuum Display Dock.[48] HP adds a layer to the Continuum with their HP Workplace which enables user to run a Win32 app by a virtualized server.[49] The first modular smartphone available to the public was the Fairphone 2, which was released in December 2015. Unlike most smartphones, users can remove and replace parts on this phone. Future possible developments[edit] Foldable OLED smartphones have been anticipated for years but have failed to materialize because of the relatively high failure rate when producing these screens.[citation needed] As well, creating a battery that can be folded is another hurdle.[50] Hardware[edit] Display[edit] Main article: Display device Samsung Galaxy Note 5, S6 edge+, Note 7 One of the main characteristics of smartphones is their screen. It usually fills most of the phone\'s front surface (about 70%); screen size usually defines the size of a smartphone. Many have an aspect ratio of 16:9; some are 4:3 or other ratios. They are measured in diagonal inches, starting from 2.45 inches.[51] Phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called "phablets". Smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches commonly are shifted while using a single hand, since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface, or used in place with both hands. Liquid-crystal displays are the most common; others are IPS, LED, OLED, AMOLED and E Ink displays. In the 2010s, Braille screens, which can be used by visually impaired people are being developed. It is expected that Braille screens will use some type of microfluidics technology.[52] Accessories[edit] A selection of protective cases. The small cut-out in the left-hand corner is to enable the person to use the digital camera. As with cellphones, a range of accessories are sold for smartphones, including cases, screen protectors, power charging cables, add-on batteries, headphones, combined headphone-microphones which allow a person to use the phone without holding it to the ear, and Bluetooth-enabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to music files stored on their smartphones. Cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive, heavy-duty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell. Some cases have a "book"-like form, with a cover that the user opens to use the device; when the cover is closed, it protects the screen. Some "book"-like cases have additional pockets for credit cards, thus enabling people to use them as wallets. Accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers. Software[edit] Mobile operating systems[edit] Main article: Mobile operating system Android[edit] Main article: Android (operating system) Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, and backed by an industry consortium known as the Open Handset Alliance. It is an open source platform with optional proprietary components, including a suite of flagship software for Google services, and the application and content storefront Google Play.[53] Android was officially introduced via the release of its inaugural device, the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1) on 20 October 2008.[54] As an open source product, Android has also been the subject of third-party development. Development groups have used the Android source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system, such as CyanogenMod, to add features to the OS and provide newer versions of Android to devices that no longer receive official updates from their vendor.[55][56][57] Forked versions of Android have also been adopted by other vendors, such as Amazon.com, who used its "Fire OS" on a range of tablets and the Fire Phone.[58][59] As it is a non-proprietary platform that has shipped on devices covering a wide range of market segments, Android has seen significant adoption. Gartner Research estimated that 325 million Android smartphones were sold during the fourth quarter of 2015, leading all other platforms. Samsung Electronics, who produces Android devices, was also the top smartphone vendor across all platforms in the same period of time.[60] Android is the top-selling smartphone OS in 2016.[61][62] iOS[edit] Main article: iOS iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a proprietary mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. primarily for its iPhone product line. The iPhone was first unveiled in January 2007. The device introduced numerous design concepts that have been adopted by modern smartphone platforms, such as the use of multi-touch gestures for navigation, eschewing physical controls such as physical keyboards in favor of those rendered by the operating system itself on its touchscreen (including the keyboard), and the use of skeumorphism making features and controls within the user interface resemble real-world objects and concepts in order to improve their usability.[63][64] In 2008, Apple introduced the App Store, a centralized storefront for purchasing new software for iPhone devices.[65][66] iOS can also integrate with Apple\'s desktop music program iTunes to sync media to a personal computer.[67][68] The dependency on a PC was removed with the introduction of iCloud on later versions of iOS, which provides synchronization of user data via internet servers between multiple devices.[69] The iPhone line\'s early dominance was credited with reshaping the smartphone industry, and helping make Apple one of the world\'s most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011. However, the iPhone and iOS have generally been in second place in worldwide market share.[60][70][71] Windows 10 Mobile[edit] Main article: Windows 10 Mobile Windows 10 Mobile (formerly known as Windows Phone) is from Microsoft. It is closed source and proprietary. It has the third largest installed base on smartphones behind Android and iOS. Unveiled on February 15, 2010, Windows Phone includes a user interface inspired by Microsoft\'s Metro Design Language. It is integrated with Microsoft services such as OneDrive and Office, Xbox Music, Xbox Video, Xbox Live games and Bing, but also integrates with many other non-Microsoft services such as Facebook and Google accounts. Windows Phone devices are made primarily by Microsoft Mobile/Nokia, and also by HTC and Samsung. In January 2015, Microsoft announced that its Windows Phone brand will be phased out and replaced with Windows 10 Mobile, bringing tighter integration and unification with its PC counterpart Windows 10, and provide a platform for smartphones and tablets with screen sizes under 8 inches. Windows Mobile smartphone series has had poor adoption, that also led to a decrease in third-party applications, and some vendors ended their support for Windows Mobile altogether.[72][73] As of 2016, Windows 10 Mobile global market share dropped below 0.6%.[74] Tizen[edit] Main article: Tizen Tizen is a Linux-based operating system for devices, including smartphones, tablets, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) devices, smart TVs, laptops and smart cameras. Tizen is a project within the Linux Foundation and is governed by a Technical Steering Group (TSG) composed of Samsung and Intel among others. In April 2014, Samsung released the Samsung Gear 2 and the Gear 2 Neo, running Tizen.[75] The Samsung Z1 is the first smartphone produced by Samsung that runs Tizen; it was released in the Indian market on January 14, 2015.[76] Sailfish OS[edit] Main article: Sailfish OS The Sailfish OS is based on the Linux kernel and Mer.[77] Additionally Sailfish OS includes a partially or completely proprietary multi-tasking user interface programmed by Jolla. This user interface differentiate Jolla smartphones from others.[78] Sailfish OS is intended to be a system made by many of the MeeGo team, which left Nokia to form Jolla, utilizing funding from Nokia\'s "Bridge" program which helps establish and support start-up companies formed by ex-Nokia employees.[79][80][81] Ubuntu Touch[edit] Main article: Ubuntu Touch Ubuntu Touch (also known as Ubuntu Phone) is a mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system developed by Canonical UK Ltd and Ubuntu Community.[82] It is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Discontinued operating systems[edit] BlackBerry 10[edit] Main article: BlackBerry 10 In early 2010s, BlackBerry Limited started making new devices on a new platform named "BlackBerry 10", which is based on their BlackBerry Tablet OS, to replace the BlackBerry OS.[83] While the company start to release smartphone based on other operating systems (Android) from 2015, with the BlackBerry Priv,[84] they claim their would be no new devices of BB10 and they would still support the BlackBerry 10.[85] BlackBerry OS[edit] Main article: BlackBerry OS In 1999, RIM released its first BlackBerry devices, providing secure real-time push-email communications on wireless devices. Services such as BlackBerry Messenger provide the integration of all communications into a single inbox. In September 2012, RIM announced that the 200 millionth BlackBerry smartphone was shipped. As of September 2014, there were around 46 million active BlackBerry service subscribers.[86] In early 2010s, RIM has undergone a platform transition, changing its company name to BlackBerry Limited and making new devices on a new platform named "BlackBerry 10".[83] Windows Mobile[edit] Main article: Windows Mobile Windows Mobile was based on the Windows CE kernel and first appeared as the Pocket PC 2000 operating system. Throughout its lifespan, the operating system was available in both touchscreen and non-touchscreen formats. It was supplied with a suite of applications developed with the Microsoft Windows API and was designed to have features and appearance somewhat similar to desktop versions of Windows. Third parties could develop software for Windows Mobile with no restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Software applications were eventually purchasable from Windows Marketplace for Mobile during the service\'s brief lifespan. Windows Mobile was eventually phased out in favor of Windows Phone OS. Symbian[edit] Main article: Symbian Home screen of Nokia Belle OS Feature Pack 2 Symbian was originally developed by Psion as EPOC32. It was the world\'s most widely used smartphone operating system until Q4 2010, though the platform never gained popularity in the U.S., as it did in Europe and Asia. The first Symbian phone, the touchscreen Ericsson R380 Smartphone, was released in 2000,[87][88] and was the first device marketed as a "smartphone".[89] It combined a PDA with a mobile phone.[90] Variants of Symbian OS began to emerge, most notably Symbian UIQ, MOAP and S60, each supported by different manufacturers. With the creation of Symbian Foundation in 2008, Symbian OS was unified under one variant under the stewardship of Nokia. In February 2011, Nokia announced that it would replace Symbian with Windows Phone as the operating system on all of its future smartphones, with the platform being abandoned over the following few years.[91] Firefox OS[edit] Main article: Firefox OS Firefox OS was demonstrated by Mozilla in February 2012. It was designed to have a complete community-based alternative system for mobile devices, using open standards and HTML5 applications. The first commercially available Firefox OS phones were ZTE Open and Alcatel One Touch Fire. As of 2014, more companies had partnered with Mozilla including Panasonic (which was making a smart TV with Firefox OS) and Sony.[92] In December 2015, Mozilla announced that it would phase out development of Firefox OS for smartphones, and would reposition the project to focus on other forms of Internet-connected devices.[93] Bada[edit] Main article: Bada The Bada operating system for smartphones was announced by Samsung in November 2009.[94][95] The first Bada-based phone was the Samsung Wave S8500, released in June 2010.[96][97] Samsung shipped 4.5 million phones running Bada in Q2 of 2011.[98] In 2013, Bada merged with a similar platform called Tizen. webOS[edit] Main article: webOS webOS is a proprietary mobile operating system running on the Linux kernel, initially developed by Palm, which launched with the Palm Pre. After being acquired by HP, two phones (the Veer and the Pre 3) and a tablet (the TouchPad) running webOS were introduced in 2011. On August 18, 2011, HP announced that webOS hardware was to be discontinued[99] but would continue to support and update webOS software and develop the webOS ecosystem.[100] HP released webOS as open source under the name Open webOS, and plans to update it with additional features.[101] On February 25, 2013 HP announced the sale of WebOS to LG Electronics, who used the operating system for its current "smart" or Internet-connected TVs, but not smartphones. In January 2014, Qualcomm has announced that it has acquired technology patents from HP, which includes all the WebOS patents.[102] Palm OS[edit] Main article: Palm OS In late 2001, Handspring launched the Springboard GSM phone module with limited success. In May 2002, Handspring released the Palm OS Treo 270 smartphone, which did not support Springboard, with both a touchscreen and a full keyboard. The Treo had wireless web browsing, email, calendar, a contact organizer and mobile third-party applications that could be downloaded or synced with a computer.[103] Handspring was purchased by Palm, Inc which released the Treo 600 and continued releasing Treo devices with a few Treo devices using Windows Mobile. MeeGo/Maemo/Moblin[edit] Main articles: MeeGo, Maemo, and Moblin MeeGo is an operating system created from the source code of Moblin (produced by Intel) and Maemo (produced by Nokia). Before that, Nokia used Maemo on some of its smartphones and internet tablets (such as Nokia N810 and N900). MeeGo was originally envisioned to power a variety of devices from netbooks, tablets to smartphones and smart TVs. However, the only smartphones which used MeeGo was the Nokia N9 and Nokia N950 (MeeGo v1.2 Harmattan). Following Nokia\'s decision to move to Windows Phone OS in 2011 and to cease MeeGo development, the Linux Foundation canceled MeeGo in September 2011 in favor of the development of Tizen. Mobile app[edit] Main article: Mobile app Application stores[edit] Main article: List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices The introduction of Apple\'s App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July 2008 popularized manufacturer-hosted online distribution for third-party applications (software and computer programs) focused on a single platform. There are a huge variety of apps, including video games, music products and business tools. Up until that point, smartphone application distribution depended on third-party sources providing applications for multiple platforms, such as GetJar, Handango, Handmark, and PocketGear. Following the success of the App Store, other smartphone manufacturers launched application stores, such as Google\'s Android Market (now Google Play Store) and RIM\'s BlackBerry App World in April 2009. In February 2014, 93% of mobile developers were targeting smartphones first for mobile app development.[104] Sales[edit] Since 1996, smartphone shipments have had positive growth. In November 2011, 27% of all photographs created were taken with camera-equipped smartphones.[105] In September 2012, a study concluded that 4 out of 5 smartphone owners use the device to shop online.[106] Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013.[6] Worldwide shipments of smartphones topped 1 billion units in 2013, up 38% from 2012\'s 725 million, while comprising a 55% share of the mobile phone market in 2013, up from 42% in 2012.[107] In Q1 2016 for the first time the shipments dropped by 3 percent year on year. The situation was caused by the maturing China market.[108] By manufacturer[edit] The LG G3, OnePlus One, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and iPhone 6 Plus. Worldwide Smartphones Vendors Market Share Source Date Samsung Apple Inc.

Android\'s market share (measured by units shipment) rose from 33.2% in Q4 2011 to 86.8% of the market in Q2 2016. Apple\'s market share oscillated between 15% to 12.5% during the same period. Windows Phone market share also oscillated between 1.5% to 0.3%, during the same time frame. As of the end of Q3 2016, Android was the most popular operating system, with a 86.8% market share, followed by iOS with 12.5%, Windows 10 Mobile with 0.3%, and all others with 0.4%.[115] Use[edit] Social[edit] Main article: Mobile phone overuse A 2012 University of Southern California study found that unprotected adolescent sexual activity was more common among owners of smartphones.[116] A study conducted by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\'s (RPI) Lighting Research Center (LRC) concluded that smartphones, or any backlit devices, can seriously affect sleep cycles.[117] Some persons might become psychologically attached to cellphones resulting in anxiety when separated from the devices.[118] A "smombie" (a combination of "smartphone" and "zombie") is a walking person using a smartphone and not paying attention as they walk, possibly risking an accident in the process, an increasing social phenomenon.[119] The issue of slow-moving smartphone users led to the temporary creation of a "mobile lane" for walking in Chongqing, China.[120] The issue of distracted smartphone users led the city of Augsburg, Germany to embed pedestrian traffic lights in the pavement.[121] While driving[edit] Main article: Mobile phones and driving safety Main article: Texting while driving A New York City driver using two handheld mobile phones at once. Mobile phone use while driving, including talking on the phone, texting, or operating other phone features, is common but controversial. It is widely considered dangerous due to distracted driving. Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents. In September 2010, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that 995 people were killed by drivers distracted by cell phones. In March 2011 a US insurance company, State Farm Insurance, announced the results of a study which showed 19% of drivers surveyed accessed the Internet on a smartphone while driving.[122] Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving. In Egypt, Israel, Japan, Portugal and Singapore, both handheld and hands-free use of a mobile phone (which uses a speakerphone) is banned. In other countries including the UK and France and in many U.S. states, only handheld phone use is banned, while hands-free use is permitted. A 2011 study reported that over 90% of college students surveyed text (initiate, reply or read) while driving.[123] The scientific literature on the dangers of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or texting while driving, is limited. A simulation study at the University of Utah found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting.[124] Due to the increasing complexity of smartphones, this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices. This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those which ban handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver. This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a phone call when, in fact, they were using the device legally, for example, when using the phone\'s incorporated controls for car stereo, GPS or satnav. A sign along Bellaire Boulevard in Southside Place, Texas (Greater Houston) states that using mobile phones while driving is prohibited from 7:30 am to 9:30 am and from 2:00 pm to 4:15 pm A 2010 study reviewed the incidence of mobile phone use while cycling and its effects on behaviour and safety.[125] In 2013 a national survey in the US reported the number of drivers who reported using their cellphones to access the Internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four.[126] A study conducted by the University of Illinois examined approaches for reducing inappropriate and problematic use of mobile phones, such as using mobile phones while driving.[127] Accidents involving a driver being distracted by talking on a mobile phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding. In the United Kingdom, from 27 February 2007, motorists who are caught using a hand-held mobile phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of 60.[128] This increase was introduced to try to stem the increase in drivers ignoring the law.[129] Japan prohibits all mobile phone use while driving, including use of hands-free devices. New Zealand has banned hand held cellphone use since 1 November 2009. Many states in the United States have banned texting on cell phones while driving. Illinois became the 17th American state to enforce this law.[130] As of July 2010, 30 states had banned texting while driving, with Kentucky becoming the most recent addition on July 15.[131] Public Health Law Research maintains a list of distracted driving laws in the United States. This database of laws provides a comprehensive view of the provisions of laws that restrict the use of mobile communication devices while driving for all 50 states and the District of Columbia between 1992, when first law was passed through December 1, 2010. The dataset contains information on 22 dichotomous, continuous or categorical variables including, for example, activities regulated (e.g., texting versus talking, hands-free versus handheld), targeted populations, and exemptions.[132] Legal[edit] Main article: Smartphone wars A "patent war" between Samsung and Apple started when the latter claimed that the original Galaxy S Android phone copied the interface and possibly the hardware of Apple\'s iOS for the iPhone 3GS. There was also smartphone patents licensing and litigation involving Sony, Google, Apple Inc., Samsung, Microsoft, Nokia, Motorola, Huawei, and HTC, among others. The conflict is part of the wider "patent wars" between multinational technology and software corporations. To secure and increase their market share, companies granted a patent can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods the patent covers. Since 2010 the number of lawsuits, counter-suits, and trade complaints based on patents and designs in the market for smartphones, and devices based on smartphone OSes such as Android and iOS, has increased significantly. Initial suits, countersuits, rulings, licence agreements, and other major events began in 2009 as the smartphone market grew more rapidly. Medical[edit] Main article: Mobile app With the rise in number of mobile medical apps in the market place, government regulatory agencies raised concerns on the safety of the use of such applications. These concerns were transformed into regulation initiatives worldwide with the aim of safeguarding users from untrusted medical advice.[133] Security[edit] Main articles: Mobile security, Malware, Mobile virus, and Media Transfer Protocol Smartphone malware is easily distributed through an insecure app store.[134][135] Often malware is hidden in pirated versions of legitimate apps, which are then distributed through third-party app stores.[136][137] Malware risk also comes from what\'s known as an "update attack", where a legitimate application is later changed to include a malware component, which users then install when they are notified that the app has been updated.[138] As well, one out of three robberies in 2012 in the United States involved the theft of a mobile phone. An online petition has urged smartphone makers to install kill switches in their devices.[139] In 2014, Apple\'s "Find my iPhone" and Google\'s "Android Device Manager" can disable phones that have been lost/stolen. With BlackBerry Protect in OS version 10.3.2, devices can be rendered unrecoverable to even BlackBerry\'s own Operating System recovery tools if incorrectly authenticated or dissociated from their account.[140] Sleep[edit] Main article: Electronic media and sleep Using smartphones late at night can disturb sleep, due to the brightly lit screen affecting melatonin levels and sleep cycles. In an effort to alleviate these issues, several apps that change the color temperature of a screen to a warmer hue based on the time of day to reduce the amount of blue light generated have been developed for Android, while iOS 9.3 integrated similar, system-level functionality known as "Night Shift". Amazon released a feature known as "blue shade" in their Fire OS "Bellini" 5.0 and later. It has also been theorized that for some users, addicted use of their phones, especially before they go to bed, can result in "ego depletion". Many people also use their phones as alarm clocks, which can also lead to loss of sleep. [141][142][143][144][145] Comparison with feature phones[edit] Smartphones have presented issues similar to those affecting other mobile phones. As well, there are some issues which are unique to smartphones. Battery[edit] A high-capacity portable battery charger. Compared to earlier non-smartphone mobile phones, smartphone battery life has generally been poor, due to the significant power requirements of their computer systems and color screens. Poor smartphone battery life has negatively affected customer satisfaction.[146][147][148] There is also a trend towards using batteries that the user cannot replace.[149] Smartphone users have addressed the challenge of limited battery life by purchasing additional chargers for use outside the home, at work, and in cars and by buying portable external "battery packs". External battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable and custom-made models that "piggyback" onto a smartphone\'s case. Most recently, Samsung had to recall millions of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to a battery issue. [150] Terminology[edit] "Phablet", a portmanteau of the words phone and tablet, describes smartphones with larger screens.[151][152] "Superphone" is also used by some companies to market phones with unusually large screens and other expensive features.[153][154] "Ultra premium phone" is a term used to identify a smartphone which has top of the line specifications.

Discover the transformative power of an LG smartphone. Designed to help you make life good, our smartphones can help you get organized -- and stay organized -- manage your to-do list, document life\'s best moments, make plans, talk with friends and family, send email, and even shop on the go. And with the latest technology, they make doing it all fast and easy. Just a few of the available features and functions include: HD IPS Display: With deep blacks, vivid colors and images that can be seen clearly from virtually any angle, phones with HD IPS displays let you see your favorite sites, apps and photos in flawless detail, and your favorite entertainment will take on a cinematic quality. Smart Keyboard: To make email and text messaging easier, the available Smart Keyboard feature is height-adjustable so you can type with greater accuracy, offers word recognition for faster typing, and gives you the power to easily make corrections. LG Health: Turn your smartphone with LG Health into a goal-tracking machine. By entering your fitness goals, you can track your progress daily and take control of your health. Enhanced Security: With available features like Knock Code, Guest Mode, and Content Lock, you can protect your smartphone and control what information is accessible when you let someone borrow your phone. microSD Slot: Capture as much video or snap as many pictures as you want without running out of storage. The microSD slots on many of our smartphones support cards with up to 2 terabytes of memory -- in addition to the on-board memory that your phone comes equipped with. Rear Key: For convenient -- and ambidextrous -- access to controls when your phone is in use, rear keys on certain phones lay flat against the device and feature a textured design that makes them easy to recognize by touch. Located where your index finger naturally lies against the back of your phone, they make it easy to adjust the volume while a call is in progress. LG smartphones give you the power to do more at home and on the go. Whether it\'s tracking your fitness goals, capturing special moments, talking with loved ones or making reservations at the hottest restaurant in town -- with incredibly fast connections and the available features you need, it\'s all right at your fingertips.

Best Smartphone For Every NeedDarren Orf7/22/16 9:10amFiled to: The Best SmartphoneThe BestsBest S6iPhone 6iPhone 6 PlusLG G4OnePlus OneNexus 6Nexus34131EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalink What s the best smartphone? It s a question I hear at least once or twice a month. Advertisement That s fine. It comes with the territory, really. I write about all kinds of technology all day, every day, but none so much as smartphones. I ve reviewed many of the major ones released in the past year, from the dirt-cheap to the metal and glossy. They all have something to add in their own way, but only a handful really stand out.And as you d imagine, the answer is complicated. The funny thing about buying a smartphone in 2016 is that it s hard to go wrong. Not too long ago, even great phones could have terrible battery life, be bogged down by gobs of unwanted software, have an awful camera, or be missing a crucial feature or two. Now, we find almost every major handset will last till bedtime, take decent photos, display them on an excellent screen, blaze through apps with a speedy processor, and browse the web with fast LTE connectivity. Advertisement If you want a great smartphone, all you really need to do is avoid phones that pretend to be excellent, but aren t.So if all good phones are great phones, what makes a phone The Best? It simply had to be better than every other phone at providing something people crave. That was the bar we set. The Best Overall: The Galaxy S7 EdgeThe Galaxy S7 Edge (and its smaller sibling, the S7) are two remarkable phones. In 2015, the Galaxy S6 held our Best Smartphone accolade for many months until it was eventually dethroned by the impressive Nexus 6P. Advertisement Sponsored But Samsung improves on the S6 in all the right places. It keeps the classy glass-and-metal design but adds on impressive waterproofing without compromising design. It actually makes you wonder what the Galaxy S7 Active, Samsung s rugged Galaxy lineup, will have to offer. But the Galaxy S7 camera is also a cut above what s come before it. With an f/1.7 aperture so you can take phenomenal photos in lowlight, and a redesigned photo sensor means the S7 is almost always in focus.The reason I m singling out the 5.5-inch Edge over the 5.1-inch S7 isn t for it s Edge-like features (which are ok but whatever). The bigger Edge device also means a bigger battery and I saw noticeable differences in how much time I would get out of the S7 and S7 Edge comparatively. If you re not the biggest fan of large phones, Samsung packs in a lot of screen into a relatively small frame. It s the smallest 5.5-inch phone I ve ever held. Advertisement Factor in a great processor, display, and build quality, and it s almost a no-brainer that the Galaxy S7 is the best phone you can buy right now. However, many companies like HTC and Apple, haven t shown what s in store for 2016 quite yet, so who knows how long the S7 will remain on top. The Best For Android Purists: Nexus 6PHuawei and Google s team-up on the Nexus 6P has created a smartphone that s built for everyone, and it s the real good. The 6P fixes everything wrong with 2014\'s Nexus 6 and creates something that s the perfect vessel for pure Android. Nexus 6P Review: The Android Phone For Everyone Nexus 6P Review: The Android Phone For Everyone Nexus 6P Review: The Android Phone For Everyone Google-designed Nexus phones have been beating the handsets designed by third-parties for a few Read more Read more The 6P is Google through and through from the hardware design, to the operating system, and even to the very carrier if you so desire. It leverages everything new in Android, like a fingerprint sensor, and includes new hardware like the Android Sensor Hub that can turn that usually terrible battery life into a guaranteed full days worth (and beyond). Advertisement Advertisement Although it s only $500, which is definitely expensive but not quite premium prices, it still retains the look and feel of an luxe piece of gadget. It s a Nexus phone cloaked in metal, and its design fits nicely with all other smartphones of its caliber. But in a sea of Android that s still full of sub-par skins and ROMs, the Nexus 6P shines with its bloat-free software. It s incredibly fast, great-looking, and an all-around solid choice. The Best Small Phone: Apple iPhone SEThe iPhone 6s used to occupy this hallowed position as best smartphone in a tiny package, then Apple packed all the best bits from the 6s in an even smaller, 4-inch frame. The same speedy processor and 12 megapixel, 4k-shooting camera all make an appearance, and while some tech like the arguably useful 3D Touch doesn t make the cut, Apple still brought on its best feature live photos. iPhone SE Review: The Phone That Proves Apple Is Out of Ideas iPhone SE Review: The Phone That Proves Apple Is Out of Ideas iPhone SE Review: The Phone That Proves Apple Is As a tiny-fisted, lady pockets rocking iPhone 6 user, I have been very excited about the iPhone SE. Read more Read more That s not to say the iPhone SE isn t without its blemishes. For one, that small display has a sub-720p resolution and it s not nearly as bright as the 6s. But the iPhone SE s biggest sell is to people who cry foul at smartphones steady climb to bigger and bigger dimensions. The iPhone SE is a nostalgia throwback that puts modern technology into what was the undisputed King of small phones in 2013, the iPhone 5s. Advertisement But the iPhone SE is like voting for a local city councilman when only one candidate is running there s not much there to compare it to. But if your chief concern is going as small as possible without giving up the technological convenience that comes with bigger phones. Congratulations, you ve arrived. The Best Big Phone: Samsung Galaxy Note 5Yes, the Nexus 6P is big but the Galaxy Note 5 is a different kind of big. Samsung s been through five iterations of the Note series, trying to build an OS that takes advantage of that huge screen real estate, and the Note 5 is the best yet. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Review: The Best Android Phone That Spares No Expense Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Review: The Best Android Phone That Spares No Expense Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Review: The Best Android The original smartphone-with-a-stylus is all grown up. It s easily the best smartphone Samsung has Read more Read more TouchWiz is the often bemoaned skin of Android that s historically cluttered up the Android experience to a point of annoyance, but with the Note 5 and its included S Pen, some of those added software features are actually quite useful. Small tweaks have made the Note 5 better of the last year s Note 4, including a quick launch feature for S Note and Samsung Pay, which uses NFC and MST technology to create the most widely accepted mobile payment system out there. Advertisement Advertisement The premium Note 5 adopts the same look as our old smartphone champion the Galaxy S6, so it definitely looks the part and it also includes other forward-thinking features, including a YouTube livestream application build right into the camera app. Oh, and it also takes some of the best photos around. If you want to leverage every single inch of your smartphone display and don t mind Samsung toying around with Android to make that possible, the Note 5 is a great, great pick. The Best Modular Smartphone: The Moto Z Droid and Force DroidThis category is somewhat strange thanks it part to the weird gadgets themselves, and that right now, there aren t many contenders. Really, the Moto Z s only real-world competition is the LG G5, and when making that comparison, there isn t much competition at all. Where the Moto Z really pulls ahead is that its modular components, known as MotoMods, work so much better than the LG G5. The MotoMods just snap on with magnets and immediately get to work. The G5 on the other hand needs to reboot every time you want to switch out a modular component. Moto Z Review: Too Much Gadget, Not Enough Phone Moto Z Review: Too Much Gadget, Not Enough Phone Moto Z Review: Too Much Gadget, Not Enough Phone It s been nearly ten years since Apple got wacky with a tiny slab of glass and metal that begged to Read more Read more But the category could be growing quickly. Google announced during its I/O conference this year that the long-awaited Project Ara smartphone, a modular device that has been in the works for years, will finally be available for purchase in 2017. It s uncertain if these three phones will be enough to spark a whole new category of mobile devices or not, but if you want to get in on the ground floor, the Moto Z Droid is currently your best bet. Advertisement Unfortunately, as of July 2016, the phone is only available through Verizon, though a GSM capable variant is coming, and glimpsing the future will also cost a pretty penny around $624 to $730 just for the phone and the mods costing anywhere between $60 and $300. Turns out the future is expensive. The Best Phone on a Budget: OnePlus3The OnePlus 3 is, by almost every degree, an upgrade over our former Best Cheap Smartphone champion, the OnePlus 2. After two years, OnePlus has finally outpaced the growing pains of making new hardware and combined powerful specs, smooth software, and a compelling price to form the new OnePlus 3. OnePlus 3 Review: The Best Cheap Phone You Can Buy OnePlus 3 Review: The Best Cheap Phone You Can Buy OnePlus 3 Review: The Best Cheap Phone You Can Buy In 2014, OnePlus arrived out of nowhere with a powerful idea: What if a phone could look good, be Read more Read more For the purpose of this list, this phone exists to entice you to a price that might be just outside of what s typically considered cheap. After all, $400 is nothing to sneeze at. However, compared to iPhones and Galaxies that can reach upwards of $1000+, it is significantly discounted for a premium phone. It also no longer uses the painfully terrible invite system, so this year you might be able to actually buy one. Advertisement Advertisement The two big winners here are design and software. The OnePlus 3 fits comfortably as one of the best-designed phones out there with an all-metal design and a slimmer body. For software, OnePlus sticks with its own version of Android, Oxygen OS, and because the software is in-house, OnePlus has made several optimizations across the OS to make the phone feel faster. Seriously, compared to the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 6s this thing holds its own or even exceeds when it comes to speed. In every sense of the phrase, OnePlus has finally created a true Flagship Killer. If you want a few more cheap options, check out our Cheap Smartphone Bests. iPhone 6s/6s Plus (demoted 4/2016) Advertisement A fantastic smartphone. If you want iOS and don t want something small, this is your guy. But newer Android phones slightly edge out Apple in performance. I expect this to change with the iPhone 7 this fall. Read the full review. LG G5The LG G5 is by no means a terrible phone. But it s biggest selling point it s modular ecosystem is half-baked at best. Also it s industrial design is a step in the wrong direction. Read the full review. OnePlus 2 (demoted 7/2016) Advertisement Advertisement This used to be our favorite cheap smartphone, but the OnePlus 3 outshines it in almost every way. Better camera, battery life, and software. You had a good run OnePlus 2, but your time is up. Read the full review. Huawei Honor 5xThe 5x comes in at an impressive $200 with an all-metal build quality. But its operating system, though designed to look like iOS, is only a mere shadow of Apple s software when it comes to functionality and style. Read the full review. Nextbit Robin Advertisement This guy is one of the most stylish phones available, and it s got a processor that s only a year out of date to keep the price down. It s also has a feature to store you apps in the cloud. Read the full review. LG V10 Advertisement This guy is basically a powerhouse G4 in phablet form, a serious contender for big phone enthusiasts. But some of its hardware experiments border on gimmick-y than being genuinely useful. Read the full review. Blackberry Priv Advertisement Blackberry made the move it should have made about 4 years ago and is now on Android, but it still has some issues to iron out. I d pass on this first generation phone. Read the full review. Moto X Pure EditionA totally great smartphone for $400, but there are equally great phones for cheaper and better phones for only slightly more, so it kind of gets lost in the shuffle. Worth a look if you prefer a clean Android UI. Read the full review. Nexus 6 (demoted 11/2015) Advertisement Advertisement This phone held the Best for Pure Android (and Movies) category for its big screen and stock Android OS. But with the more manageable 6P, the Nexus 6 need no longer apply. Read the full review. Sony Xperia Z3The Z5 is out now, which is still tricky to find in the US but not impossible. You can even get the 4K-equipped Z5 Premium but that seems like the definition of overkill. Lumia 950 and XL Advertisement Windows 10 on a phone doesn t quite convert all the magic of the desktop experience to the palm of your hand. If you re a Windows phone acolyte, sure, go for it. But for most others, there are better options. Galaxy S6 (demoted 11/2015) Advertisement Still a fantastic smartphone with a swiss army knife of features, like a great payment platform and wireless charging capabilities. It s just not quite as great an experience as the 6P in our opinion. But if you re giving all the front runners due consideration, the Galaxy S6 still belongs in that group, benefiting a smartphone once considered The Best Overall. Galaxy S6 Edge Advertisement The Best for Showing Off, perhaps. The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is a fine phone, and it looks slick, but you re paying an extra $100 for worse ergonomics while everything else stays the same. Galaxy S6 ActiveWe tried it. Not bad, but you d get better protection by simply buying a case. HTC A9 Advertisement Advertisement The HTC A9 is impressive in many ways. It s incredibly thin and has great build quality that s synonymous with HTC, but man, it looks just like an iPhone. If you want the iPhone look running Android, this is a good pick, but if you don t meet that exact definition, you re almost certainly better served elsewhere. Droid Turbo 2The Droid Turbo 2 makes advancements in some areas, such as a better processor and a shatterproof display. But it doesn t look very great, and it is absolutely filled with bloatware and branding from Verizon. Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Advertisement Take everything awesome about Sony s Z3, and shrink it down for smaller hands. Give it even better battery life and, yeah, a lower res screen. Then tease poor Americans by only selling it off-contract, on GSM networks, for less than a year. We called it Android s Best Kept Secret. Microsoft / Nokia Lumia Advertisement Despite Microsoft s latest woes, hardware s never been the problem with Lumia devices. In fact, they have some of the best cameras you ll find. But that software is just not as good as iOS and Android. Not even close. If you actually want to use lots of apps, look elsewhere. HTC One (M8) for Windows Advertisement The HTC One M8 was great, sure over a year ago. And while Windows Phone actually suits this device pretty well, a neglected app store as well as a neglected mobile OS means you re much better off with practically any alternative.BlackBerryNot a chance. Even the best BlackBerry isn t good enough. The BlackBerry operating system is a dead end. If you buy one, you ll be sorry when BlackBerry moves to Android instead.Amazon Fire Phone Advertisement Advertisement LOL no.UPDATES:7/16/15: Original post Advertisement 11/2015: Nexus 6P awarded Best Overall; iPhone 6s awarded Best Small Phone; Galaxy Note 5 awarded Best Big Phone; OnePlus 2 awarded Best Phone on a Budget.

S'Smartphone - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia = /(^ \\s)client-nojs(\\s $)/, "$1client-js$2" ); (window.RLQ=window.RLQ ( $, jQuery, require, module ) { Smartphone From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search function mfTempOpenSection(id){var open-block";} Android smartphones Samsung Smartphones A smartphone is a mobile phone that can do more than other phones.[1] They work as a computer but are mobile devices small enough to fit in a user\'s hand. Uses include: Sending and receiving emails, text, photographs and multimedia messages Registering contacts calculator, currency, alarm, etc. functions Browsing the Internet Playing games Smartphone used to read Wikipedia The HTC Desire Z, with a large touchable display and a QWERTY keyboard. Because smartphones are small computers, they run an operating system that is often common between devices to ensure compatibility. The majority of smartphones run on Apple iOS or Google Android but others use Windows Phone or BlackBerry OS.[2] Today, most smartphones are able to run more than one program (also called apps) at the same time which helps the user do things quicker and easier. Users can get more programs from the manufacturer\'s app store, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play which can help them complete special tasks. Data communication has become faster. Smart phones can send and receive data much faster than older phones. The industry uses different standards to label the data transmission rates. 2G was introduced in 1991. 2G means 2nd Generation. 2G phones transmit data at about the same speed as a 56kbit/s (kilobits per second) dial-up modem would get. 3G was introduced in 2002. Depending on where they are, 3G phones vary in speed between about 200kbit/s to 14Mbit/s (megabits per second). This is comparable to a DSL or low end cable modem speed. Most smart phones use 3G technology to make them fast enough to practically use internet and other data features. Faster 4G networks operate in many places, with speeds estimated as fast as 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s (gigabit per second). This would be as fast as some computer networks that use ethernet. Many smart phones introduced after 2010 use 4G technology. The newest phones today are even faster, using a version of 4G known as LTE.

Smartphones for Sale Find the smartphone you\'ve been shopping for at Cricket, where we have great sales and everyday prices on popular phones. So whether you\'re a fan of Samsung smartphones or iPhones, Android or Windows phones, chances are the device you\'ve been looking for is right here. Not sure what kind of smartphone to buy? Here are some things to consider: Buying a Smartphone: Understanding the Specs TIP: Use our smartphone compare feature above to see the specs for different phones side by side. Screen Size Most smartphone screens today range in size from 4 to 6 inches (diagonal). Large Screen (5.5 to 6 in) - Best for those who like to stream videos or play games - or who are near-sighted (to enlarge the smartphone screen to a larger size) Medium Screen (4.5 to 5.5 in) - A good choice for most people Small Screen (under 4.5 in) Perfect if you want a smartphone that\'s easy to carry and fits comfortably in your pocket Resolution A screen\'s resolution correlates to its clarity and definition, with higher resolutions typically being the sharpest (although there are other factors that affect picture quality). A high resolution screen is especially desirable for people who watch a lot of videos or play games on their smartphone. Common smartphone resolutions: FWVGA: 854 x 480 qHD: 960 x 540 ( full HD) HD: 1280 x 720 Full HD: 1920 x 1080 Operating System (OS) An operating system is the software that runs a smartphone. The main phone operating systems are Android, iOS (Apple), and Windows Phone. For phone buyers, the operating system is very important because it affects the phone\'s core functionality and the experience offered by the phone. Also, because phone apps are created to work with specific operating system(s) -you won\'t be able to download an app to your phone if it has an incompatible operating system. That\'s something to keep in mind when choosing a smartphone. Speed (Processor) Faster is usually better when it comes to a smartphone\'s processing speed, which is measured in GHz. A faster processor can help you download, stream, and use gaming features quickly and seamlessly. Camera Features If you\'ve ever had a digital camera, you probably know that higher mega-pixels (MP) translate into higher resolution, sharper pictures. (However, other features like the lens also impact the picture; the highest MP camera doesn\'t always produce the best picture quality.) Battery Life In general, the higher the milliamperes per hour (mAh), the higher the battery capacity - but battery life can vary depending on usage. 3000 mAh is a higher smartphone battery capacity, potentially lasting up to 15 hrs, while a 1000 mAh is a shorter battery life.

Post navigation Older posts Sensor Fusion Market Analysis and Value Forecast Snapshot by End-use Industry 2016-2026 Future Market Insights January 25, 2017 Sensor-fusion is at the heart of our work at Fullpower together with AI, Machine Learning and Sleep and ambulatory sciences. Click to view the complete analysis: An Introduction to Understanding Sleep Fullpower.com Philippe Kahn January 22, 2017 Introduction: As my colleague Mark Christensen and I were sailing across oceans double-handed (just two of us on a fast high tech sailboat), chasing and beating records, we discovered that we were both so busy that none of us slept much more than 30 minutes at a time for weeks on end. And it worked. I mean we were performing. Why did it work? We decided to use the scientific method and to build sleep monitors and a software system that would monitor both our sleep and wake performance. Wired Magazine on Sleep and Sailing What we learned defied common wisdom. Mark and I were back in an evolutionary environment, with no constraints but that of Mother Nature and our whole beings were adapting and shedding all sorts of mis-conceptions. Just like intermittent fasting makes us healthier, there is magic to understanding sleep budgeting and optimization. Here I share some of our findings based on over 100,000 nautical miles sailed across oceans around the world. I hope that you find this first installment useful and look forward to your feedback. Your Sleeptracker statistics and what is normal Preface: We are all different. However we can learn a lot from the Sleeptracker community, comparing our own sleep to people like me to help us gain a better understanding of our sleep. So these normal values and ranges simply reflect Sleeptracker stats for 90% of the population, 90% of the time. If you are an elite athlete or have a chronic condition you may find yourself out of range for some of the stats. It s important to understand where you are and make small improvements over time. Be patient with yourself. Total Sleep is not the time spent in bed, but the time when you were actually asleep. A restful night s sleep for most people ranges from 6 to 9 hours. Statistically, females on average tend to sleep a little more than males. Everyone is different. What counts is how rested you feel and making small improvements. For example, if you find initially you sleep for 6 hours on average, try to set your goal for 6 hours 15 minutes. Iterate until you feel more rested. Time to Sleep is the time elapsed between starting a sleep recording and actually falling asleep. If you fall asleep in less then 3 minutes you are probably sleep deprived. If it takes you more than 30 minutes to fall asleep (once you ve decided to fall asleep, not if you are simply reading a great book), it would be good to look at factors which can impact time to sleep such as when and what you ate and drank before bed, caffeine consumption, and how much exercise you ve had and when that occurred. Finishing eating and drinking a couple of hours before bed, stretching, and having a cool and quiet bedroom helps. Light Sleep, REM Sleep and Deep Sleep: Sleep occurs in waves, with a crest called REM (rapid eye movement) when we dream, and a trough called deep sleep when we are in maximum recovery mode, together with several intermediate stages. All stages of the sleep wave are necessary, and sleep typically comes in multiple waves. Depending on the individual, each wave of sleep lasts 45 to 90 minutes and and we experience between four to six waves of sleep (complete cycles) per night. The highest percentage of deep sleep is experienced during the earlier waves. Awake time displays how long your awake events are during the night. Often, we don t even remember some of these awake events if they are short. However if you are awake for more than 12 minutes, it may be a good idea to get up and do something relaxing. Pascal, Newton, Mozart, Debussy, Einstein, Nadia Boulanger and many other geniuses would actually sleep in two shifts : they called it First Sleep and Second Sleep and claim they did their best work in the middle of the night. That s hard to do in a modern world with standardized work hours. Wakeup displays the number of awake events you experienced during your sleep. If they are short, you may not remember them. Up to 3 to 5 wake events is quite normal and with young children or pets some of us experience several awake events each night. Sleep Score (range 1 -100): Sleeptracker makes it easy to rate your sleep from day one, with your Sleep Score . For example, there are people with a sleep score of 50 out of 100 initially, who after a few months of using Sleeptracker improved their sleep score to 75, and continue to improve. The ideal sleeper will look for a sleep score of 90+ over time. But many healthy individuals function well at 75 or above. Sleep Efficiency is the percentage of time spent sleeping. For example spending 8 hours in bed and 6 of those hours asleep is a sleep efficiency of 75%. Some people start at 50%, and after a few months reach a sleep efficiency of 75% and continue improving incrementally. With an 85% sleep efficiency or higher you are doing well. Percentage of Sleep Goal: This is a great tool to incrementally increase your total sleep time. Set your initial sleep goal at a realistic time for you, then increase your goal by 10% until you beat it, then iterate. Unrealistic goals are demotivating. Small incremental wins are empowering. Average Breathing Rate is the number of breaths you take in a minute. Sleeptracker measures your breathing rate continuously throughout the night and produces an easy to understand line graph. For healthy individuals between age 16 and 65, resting respiratory rate between 10-22 breaths per minute are considered normal. After about 67 years of age it s common for respiration rate to increase by up to 20%. Snoring and sleep apnea affect breathing rate, as well as illness, pain or fever. Average Heart Rate is the number of beats your heart takes in a minute. Sleeptracker measures your heart rate continuously throughout the night and produces an easy to understand line graph. A heart rate between 40 and 85 is considered healthy. Snoring and sleep apnea affect heart rate, as well as alcohol, caffeine and sugar consumption, illness, pain or fever. Sleep is your recovery mechanism, and you will notice the more restful your sleep, the lower your heart rate when you wake up. Throughout the night as sleep rebuilds your body, your heart rate decreases in small steady increments. What is sleep and why do we, and mammals, sleep? Sleep is the recovery mechanism for all of us. It s when we rebuild our bodies, our muscles, cleanse our organs, and rewire our brain. Sleep is necessary. The Sleeptracker monitor helps us understand and improve our sleep. Here is an example: Sleeptracker will automatically measure your heart rate through the night, and you can see that as your cardiovascular system repairs and rebuilds during sleep, by the morning your resting heart rate is often significantly lower for a healthy individual. How do I sleep? Sleeptracker makes it easy to rate my sleep from day one, with your Sleep Score . For example, there are people with a sleep score of 50 out of 100 initially who after a few months of using Sleeptracker improved their sleep score to 75, and continue to improve after that. The ideal sleeper will look for a sleep score of 90+ over time. But many healthy individuals function well at 75 or above. What does how I sleep mean? Practically, how we sleep in the long-term has an important impact on how we perform at work or at the gym, on our mood, and on our overall health. What are sleep cycles, and how do they affect my sleep? Sleep occurs in waves, with a crest called REM (rapid eye movement) when we dream, and a trough called deep sleep when we are in maximum recovery mode, together with several intermediate stages. All those stages of the sleep wave are necessary, and sleep typically comes in multiple waves. Depending on the individual, each wave of sleep lasts 45 to 90 minutes and and we experience between four to six waves of sleep (complete cycles) per night. The highest percentage of deep sleep is experienced during the earlier waves. What does it mean to improve my sleep? The consequences of improving sleep are profound and measurable over time, even as we age. Improving sleep means improving overall health, work and physical performance, mood, and even relationships. There are only upsides to improving your sleep. How can I personally improve my sleep? You can improve your sleep by making small incremental changes. The power of Sleeptracker is that we can quantify the effect of these little changes, and the Sleeptracker AI-powered engine will deliver personalized insights based on your own sleep performance, as well as based on the sleep performance of people like you who are part of the Sleeptracker community. Can I really improve my sleep that much with Sleeptracker ? In a nutshell, yes! Let us consider the amount of time that we, as humans, sleep. We sleep for a third of our life. At the same time, we live in a sleep deprived world. Due to the demands of our modern world, it s not feasible to increase the amount of time we spend in bed attempting to sleep. Instead, we need to better understand our habits to improve the efficiency, performance, and overall quality of our sleep. Now consider a night where you spend 8 hours in bed, but only sleep for six of those hours; your sleep efficiency is 75%. If we increase that efficiency by only 13 percent, your six hours of sleep becomes seven hours. This increase gains you a full hour of sleep. Sleeptracker can help you improve the quality of your seep so you can sleep more, and sleep better. What happens in the first 30 days when I use Sleeptracker ? From the first day you start monitoring your sleep, Sleeptracker will be helpful. Yet, the first step to understanding how to sleep better is understanding how you sleep. In the first 30 days of use, Sleeptracker gets to know you, gives you personalized insights to help you improve your own sleep over time, and understands how you are sleeping compared to people like you . What does periodization of sleep mean? By carefully analyzing several million nights of sleep of Mr. and Ms. Everyone, Sleeptracker has come to the conclusion that sleep performance comes in waves, just like athletic performance. There will be times in life when our sleep performance decreases. For example if we catch the flu, tear a muscle or have other aches and pains, or if we have busy times at work. It s important to accept and understand this fact of life, and with the help of Sleeptracker start improving our sleep score again, patiently a little bit at a time. Many things in life seems to go in waves and in cycles. While Sleeptracker helps you improve your sleep over time, it is important to realize that improvement does not occur on a consistent continuous slope. Improvement in any realm doesn t occur at a constant rate, but overall, improvement is periodized and consistency and daily practice make a big difference. That s true with Sleeptracker too. Why is it important to store my sleep information over time as I age gracefully? Identifying correlations and trends in long-term sleep data helps us understand how our bodies, health and habits change over time. As we age, our sleep habits change. Sudden changes in our sleep as reported by Sleeptracker can be indicators of how something in our well-being may have changed, and provides a good reminder to continue improving our sleep performance. That s true with any health condition and at any age. We can always make small incremental improvements to sleep. Sleeptracker is a key to better understanding our health, and to building a healthier future. What vital signs does Sleeptracker monitor? Sleeptracker continually monitors respiration and breathing patterns, as well as fluctuations in heart rate, and qualitative and quantitative body motions. Should I take power naps during the day? Yes! Taking power naps is a great idea. This is completely natural, particularly if your sleep wasn t ideally restful. In Spanish, siesta comes from seis which means six and you will notice in general 6 hours after waking up you will feel a bit sleepy. If you have an opportunity, try a 20-30 minute power nap to recharge; no more than 30 minutes or you risk waking up groggy. 3 lessons from serial innovators O\'Reilly Esther Schindler January 9, 2017 Hint: It s not just one bright idea, repeated several times. Some people appear to be blessed. They aren t just lucky enough to have a single right idea at the right time; they keep coming up with more bright ideas that make the world better, or at least are valued enough for a profitable business model. While innovation and market success do not always have a strong correlation, there are a few things the creators often have in common. It s one thing to get lucky to have a bright idea at the exact right moment. But many of the people I admire have been lucky several times over, sometimes in different guises. Maybe it s creating a business that evolves from a solo success to a wide range of profitable endeavors under the same corporate umbrella, such as Amazon s Jeff Bezos. Or the spark of creativity may touch different realms, such as Philippe Kahn, whose success began with Borland s Turbo Pascal, then camera phones, and now working in the Internet of Things. I ve paid some attention to what these people do differently from the rest of us mere mortals, including the things they don t notice. Because, often, we take our personal strengths for granted; they are, after all, the things that require the least conscious effort. Lesson 1: It s all about technology. Except when it isn t. Always lead with technology, says Philippe Kahn. I m passionate about making things that help Ms. and Mr. Everyone. At different times, different things. But it all has to be led by unique technology innovation. You may remember Kahn s legacy at Borland, which drove software development on microcomputers. At LightSurf, it was the camera phone, accompanied by key patents. Today at Fullpower, it s the leading platform for the smartbed in the IoT smarthome, powered by machine learning and data science, he says, with a lot of innovation and patents. However, the world is full of technology that is inherently cool, but also an answer in search of a solution. Whether an innovation is an improvement over existing solutions (the iPod, a faster CPU, a more affordable compiler) or a disruptive game changer (DVDs by mail, crowdsourced classified ads), it answers questions that people immediately realize they had as soon as the answer appears. The technology breakthrough itself can be a distraction. Even though the market makers may talk about technology publicly, says Saul Kaplan, founder of the Business Innovation Factory, their attention usually is on problem solving and business models. It s part of their DNA, he says. When they stand in line at the supermarket, they are considering how to improve the buying experience, he points out. Indeed, architect and inventor Buckminster Fuller was incensed by the time wasted standing in line when the bank tried to save money by limiting the number of bank tellers, and actively did the math to figure out how much income generation the bank was losing out on in that false economy. Serial innovators constantly prototype and try on mental models in search of a better way. They fix a problem and worry about scale later, Kaplan says. ( You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. R. Buckminster Fuller) Technology can be a force multiplier, agrees Dave Gray, management consultant and author of The Connected Company (you can read a free chapter here). What tips the balance in most cases is the culture, the people, the morale. Those kinds of things win. Gray refers to work from management researcher Saras Sarasvathy, who observed that entrepreneurs focus on their capabilities and ask, Given what is currently under my control, what kinds of things could I do in the world? Kahn s innovations with the camera phone bear this out. Instead of his team trying to develop manufacturing systems (not their core knowledge set), the inventors benefited economically by their licensing patents and technology to other companies with manufacturing systems. Others, such as Apple, Google/Android, and Samsung were then able to build the industrial powerhouses that still exploit the LightSurf original 1997 vision of Point, shoot, share instantly. Lesson 2: In the desire to move forward, be willing to make your existing products obsolete. Serial innovators look for opportunities to improve their own products because they re aware someone else wants their business. Paranoia is good, Catherine Ulrich, chief product officer at Shutterstock, told the BBC. Paranoia makes you think about your competitors, and that s going to make you better. If the customer is going to find a better product, ideally it should be from the entrepreneur s own company. Surely it was better for Apple to build a Macintosh that might steal sales from the Apple//e than to wait for a competitor to invent the next improvement, because the customers money all went into the same corporate coffers. And that means leaving things behind even if you once were really proud of the innovation. Back in 2007, Steve Jobs talked about the courage it took to remove technology from Apple products in this case, support for Flash, USB, and floppy disks saying that leaving them behind lets you put energy into making those new emerging technologies be great on your platform. It s hard enough for an upstart (or startup) company to innovate over its own products, but even more difficult for large companies to do so. That s most famously examined in Clayton Christensen The Innovator s Dilemma. (Here s a great 4-minute video summary, for the impatient.) Once a product becomes a success, innovators or the organizations they build are unwilling to endanger it. Instead of chasing dreams and betting the house on them, they turn to incremental improvements and optimization of the status quo. Or, as Kaplan expresses the sentiment: You get so busy peddling the bicycle of the way your business works that you create constraints. Then along comes someone else who says, I am not constrained and can solve it another way. This isn t new, of course. MIT senior research scientist David Clark, in discussing the development of the Internet, described the attitudes about innovation during the 1960s and 1970s. A major source of doubt and skepticism was the mindset of the traditional telephone companies that basically said: first, it won t work, and second, if it does work, we re going to try to kill it because we re not interested in having something that competes with us. I actually think that this doubt and skepticism was incredibly empowering because it basically meant they didn t pay attention to us. As long as they didn t pay attention, we could do anything we wanted, so we built a network more or less over their dead body, but they couldn t stop us. In the 2004 article Why Big Companies Can t Invent, author and venture capitalist Howard Anderson explained why new technologies are seen as a threat to the market leader s profit margins. Why would RCA or GE push solid-state technology when the profits from vacuum tubes were so high? Why would Kodak push for digital cameras when its real money was made in film? All eventually entered these markets, of course, but late, and only when change was inevitable. Major corporations much prefer just-in-time innovation innovation that peaks just as older products are on the back half of their life cycle. But innovation does not choreograph so simply; it comes in fits and starts, defeats mixed with occasional breakthroughs. Little has changed. BlackBerry and Windows both suffered the fate of their owning companies focusing on the thing being sold, instead of the problem being solved, points out Peter Coffee, VP for strategic research at Salesforce. Lesson 3: Create a culture of innovation (really). People bandy about the phrase create a culture of innovation as if it s something you can order from Amazon or from which you get the parts from your local hardware store. But the serial innovators, particularly the ones who keep recreating their companies as well as their products and services, truly do encourage their people to try new things. No one here is ever told That s not your job when they propose an innovative action, says Saleforce s Coffee. For that matter, I would say that people here are genuinely expected to innovate without permission (let alone a formal organization). To avoid being disrupted, a company has to create conditions for entire new business models. Take Uber: they didn t invent anything. They saw a problem, and they created an app, says Kaplan. A few global transportation companies had all the resources and capabilities to make their own Uber, he points out. But they were stuck in their business models, with their own rules of the road. These other companies never had a sandbox in which innovative employees were challenged to explore the possible business models even if it is disruptive to us. And Uber was worth more than the global transportation company s whole industry just a few years later. Similarly, Sony had a huge division that created the Walkman. It also had a division that managed music talent, under contract. It had all the pieces. But, points out Kaplan, Jobs did it from scratch with the iPod. For serial innovators, the problem is never the idea. It s how to get the ideas off the white board and onto the ground. In the end it s about a repeatable and scalable business model and the ability to reinvent it, says Kaplan. That s what it s going to take to constantly stay relevant. And we live in a world that constantly screams for it. All you ll ever need to know about mobile phones Sunday Post Stevie Gallacher and Bill Gibb December 27, 2016 CHRISTMAS Day was one of the biggest online shopping days of the year. Experts put it down to our increasing obsession with mobile phones. So as we hunt out the bargains frequently on new handsets we ve just taken out of the Christmas wrapping here s what you may not know about your mobile best mate. The very first smartphone was launched on August 16, 1994, by IBM. It was a pioneer in commercially available touch-screen phones. Nine out of 10 mobile phones in Japan are waterproof as many people even shower with them. With a price tag of $15.3 million an Apple iPhone 5, with a 26-carat black diamond in place of the home button, became the world s most expensive phone. Next year over a third of the world s population will own a smartphone, with 2.6 billion users. Since Apple s App Store was created in 2008, more than 140 billion apps have been downloaded but a quarter are only used once in the six months after downloading. Almost 85% of phones use the Android operating system like Samsung s not Apple s iOS. You should charge your phone little and often and not necessarily leave it charging overnight when it has reached 100%. Studies have shown the average mobile phone is covered with 18 times more bacteria than a toilet handle. Mobile phones are now so common some people have developed a fear of being without one. This is called nomophobia. Even if you have an older phone it s still around 30,000 times more powerful than the computers used to take Apollo 11 astronauts to the moon. A staggering seven trillion texts are sent every year worldwide. In the UK 93% of adults own a mobile phone and 14% of us now live in a home without a landline. The first portable phone was called a DynaTAC. The original model had 35 minutes of battery life and weighed a kilo. The first public mobile phone call in the UK was made by comedian Ernie Wise in 1985 from St Katharine dock to the Vodafone head offices. Less than one in 10 Eritreans have a mobile phone subscription but in Kuwait there are more than two for every person. The first photo message ever was sent in 1997. The inventor, Philippe Kahn, took a snap of his newborn daughter Sophie and sent it to friends and relatives. Each person in the UK sends on average 170 text messages every month. The Sonim XP3300 is officially recognised as the world s toughest mobile. It can be dropped 84ft on to solid ground without breaking. Forget iPhones or Samsung Galaxys the world s biggest selling phone is the classic Nokia 1100. There have been 250 million of these handsets sold over the years.

Smartphones for Sale Find the smartphone you\'ve been shopping for at Cricket, where we have great sales and everyday prices on popular phones. So whether you\'re a fan of Samsung smartphones or iPhones, Android or Windows phones, chances are the device you\'ve been looking for is right here. Not sure what kind of smartphone to buy? Here are some things to consider: Buying a Smartphone: Understanding the Specs TIP: Use our smartphone compare feature above to see the specs for different phones side by side. Screen Size Most smartphone screens today range in size from 4 to 6 inches (diagonal). Large Screen (5.5 to 6 in) - Best for those who like to stream videos or play games - or who are near-sighted (to enlarge the smartphone screen to a larger size) Medium Screen (4.5 to 5.5 in) - A good choice for most people Small Screen (under 4.5 in) Perfect if you want a smartphone that\'s easy to carry and fits comfortably in your pocket Resolution A screen\'s resolution correlates to its clarity and definition, with higher resolutions typically being the sharpest (although there are other factors that affect picture quality). A high resolution screen is especially desirable for people who watch a lot of videos or play games on their smartphone. Common smartphone resolutions: FWVGA: 854 x 480 qHD: 960 x 540 ( full HD) HD: 1280 x 720 Full HD: 1920 x 1080 Operating System (OS) An operating system is the software that runs a smartphone. The main phone operating systems are Android, iOS (Apple), and Windows Phone. For phone buyers, the operating system is very important because it affects the phone\'s core functionality and the experience offered by the phone. Also, because phone apps are created to work with specific operating system(s) -you won\'t be able to download an app to your phone if it has an incompatible operating system. That\'s something to keep in mind when choosing a smartphone. Speed (Processor) Faster is usually better when it comes to a smartphone\'s processing speed, which is measured in GHz. A faster processor can help you download, stream, and use gaming features quickly and seamlessly. Camera Features If you\'ve ever had a digital camera, you probably know that higher mega-pixels (MP) translate into higher resolution, sharper pictures. (However, other features like the lens also impact the picture; the highest MP camera doesn\'t always produce the best picture quality.) Battery Life In general, the higher the milliamperes per hour (mAh), the higher the battery capacity - but battery life can vary depending on usage. 3000 mAh is a higher smartphone battery capacity, potentially lasting up to 15 hrs, while a 1000 mAh is a shorter battery life.

That s why it s super important to pick the phone that s best for your needs. There are many factors to consider from design and operating system to security and durability. We consider every aspect of the smartphone to determine whether it s a good buy for you or if you re better off with something else. When it comes to choosing the best smartphone, it s always a tough decision. This year was particularly difficult, because we had two incredible contenders: the iPhone 7 Plus and the Google Pixel XL. After much debate and soul searching, we landed on the iPhone 7 Plus as our top pick for the best smartphone of 2016. However, the Pixel XL is the closest second we ve ever had in this race. It very nearly won. Here s why the iPhone 7 Plus ultimately triumphed, and a list of our picks for other smartphone categories. Our pick Why should you buy this: You want the most powerful, secure, and shutterbug-friendly phone ever Our Score The best Apple iPhone 7 Plus You can t do better than the iPhone for design, security, power, and camera tech. $769.99 from Apple $769.99 from T-Mobile Who s it for: Anyone who wants the most simple, easy to use phone. How much will it cost: $770+ Why we picked the iPhone 7 Plus: What s not to love about Apple s iPhone 7 Plus? Its iconic aluminum design is now fully waterproof, its A10 Fusion processor makes it the fastest smartphone you can buy period, the dual-lens camera pulls off amazing DSLR tricks, and iOS has never looked better or been more functional. Add to that Apple s commitment to your security and privacy, as well as its industry-leading customer service, and you have one helluva smartphone. The impressive 12-megapixel dual cameras are among the most compelling reasons to buy the iPhone 7 Plus. One of the cameras is a telephoto lens that offers 2x optical hardware zoom and up to 10x software zoom. The quality of 2x zoom on the iPhone 7 Plus is just extraordinary. It beats out every other smartphone on the market. You don t lose detail, and your zoomed picture turns out excellent. You can go up to 5x in good lighting conditions without too much noticeable loss in quality, which is still better than you can say of any other smartphone s zoom. The dual-camera lenses also enable the best bokeh effect (when the background blurs around the subject of the shot) we ve ever seen on a smartphone. Other phones, including the Pixel, tend to mess up the blurring effect on the small details. Apple is also well known for reproducing colors accurately, while Android phones consistently oversaturate images. It comes down to personal preference, but we prefer the iPhone s natural hues. It also produces strong images in low light, rivaled only by the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Apple really hit it out of the park in terms of performance with the A10 Fusion processor. It s the fastest smartphone in benchmarks, leaving every Android phone in the dust. Even though it has less RAM, the iPhone 7 Plus is smoother, slicker, and more efficient than any Android phone. The battery life is a solid day and a half, which is equal to (or more than) every other phone on this list. It even comes standard with 32GB of storage, which is a big upgrade from 16GB, though not as great as last year s 64GB option. Since Apple designs the hardware and software together, iOS 10 runs like a dream on the phablet. It is the best version of iOS to date. Interactive notifications, the incorporation of 3D Touch into every aspect of the interface, and the new iMessage are a game changer for iPhone users. Every app and game meets Apple s design standards, which results in a fluid, seamless experience across the OS and other Apple devices. Instant software updates are the icing on the cake with iOS. Unlike with an Android phone, you never have to worry that your iPhone will miss an update or vital security patch. Apple has your back when it comes to security and your personal privacy. Our lives are on our phones and hackers are becoming more skilled every day. Security has never been more important and your privacy is of high value. That s why Apple went to war with the FBI to guarantee your right to encryption and data privacy. Then there s Apple s customer service. If you have an iPhone, you can walk into any Apple Store and get help for free. Apple will even repair your device right there in the store and get it back to you on the same day most of the time. No other company gives you that option. The lack of a headphone jack is the only major blight on the iPhone 7 Plus near-perfect record. It comes with Lightning EarPods, but if you have your own headphones, you may struggle with the included 3.5mm-to-lightning adapter. You may also want to purchase wireless headphones, but it neither of these scenarios are the end of the world. After two months with the iPhone 7 Plus, we can tell you with confidence that you will survive. It s not ideal, but the same change is coming to Android phones already and will be the standard in a few years time. Mark my words. I ve personally tried every Android phone on this list, and no matter how good or innovative they are, I always go back to the iPhone, and the iPhone 7 Plus is the best one yet.

It\\u2019s the first Android phone in history that can fully compete with the iPhone in several key areas: security, software updates, customer service, and software design. It\\u2019s so good we nearly named it the best smartphone of the year. Indeed, if you\\u2019re an Android fan who will never buy an iPhone, the Pixel XL is the best phone you can buy. Here\\u2019s why.<\\/p>\\n<p>Google built the Pixel XL from the ground up with partner HTC. Because of that, it was able to perfectly integrate hardware and software together into one excellent package &#8212; just like Apple does with the iPhone. That approach, plus the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip and 4GB of RAM, make the Pixel the most powerful Android phone you can buy.<\\/p>\\n<p>The pure, <a Android 7.1 Nougat software<\\/a>\\u00a0runs silky smooth on the Pixel XL. It\\u2019s also more minimalist and aesthetically pleasing with the revamped app drawer, which no longer has an icon taking up space, and the replacement of the search bar with a subtle G logo you tap to start searching. The Pixel XL\\u2019s software is ridiculously attractive and perfectly done. After using it for two weeks, looking at Android phones with user interfaces on top is hard. The Pixel just looks nicer. It even looks nicer than Android 7.0 on a Nexus 6P. It\\u2019s that attention to detail and design that makes the Pixel XL appeal to iPhone and Android users alike.<\\/p>\\n<p>Assistant is a helpful artificially intelligent bot that surpasses Siri in some ways, but doesn\\u2019t yet have third-party app integration.<\\/p>\\n<p>Then there\\u2019s the crisp, natural 5.5-inch, 2,560 x 1,440-pixel screen, which is very easy on the eyes. The Pixel\\u2019s design may not be for everyone, because of its aluminum body\\u2019s glass insert on the back of the phone, which is easy to shatter and is a fingerprint magnet. However, it feels premium and comfortable to hold. The rear fingerprint sensor is good for security and Android Pay.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Pixel XL\\u2019s 12.3-megapixel camera is nearly as good as the iPhone 7 Plus\\u2019, though it doesn\\u2019t have 2x optical zoom or the dual-camera tech to pull off accurate lens blur.

It has killer wide-angle cameras front and back, a removable battery, and a slick metal design.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\"text-align: center;\\"><strong><a full best things about the Pixel XL are its commitment to timely software updates and customer service. Pixel phones will get automatic Android software updates and security patches without delay. In fact, they will be automatically downloaded when you aren\\u2019t using the phone. No other Android phone will get more timely updates than the Pixel. That\\u2019s vitally important for your privacy and security.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Pixel XL also has 24\\/7 customer support embedded right in its own tab in the Settings menu. It\\u2019s great that you can contact Google\\u2019s support team with any questions or problems right in your phone via chat or phone call. That\\u2019s just good business.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Pixel XL may be as expensive as an iPhone, but it is well worth your money. Because it has timely software updates, it will last you longer and keep your data safer. It\\u2019s also part of a larger product ecosystem that Google is building, so it has a bright future.

Google designed both the Pixel\\u2019s hardware and software from the ground up, so this is the smoothest and fastest Android has ever been.

You can still see all your apps in the drawer by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. It\\u2019s absolutely artificially intelligent bot Assistant is just icing on the cake.

The biggest difference is that this year&#8217;s iPhone 7 is water-resistant with an IP67 rating.

There are even two new black finishes for those who want a darker look.<\\/p>\\n<p>Apple also upgraded the rear camera to a 12-megapixel shooter with a larger sensor and aperture. The front-facing shooter got an upgrade to 7 megapixels, too, so your selfies will look better than ever. The speedy A10 processor and 2GB RAM keep things moving, and iOS 10 is a revelation for iPhone users. It takes 3D Touch to another level and notifications are now interactive.

ZTE says it&#8217;s committed to updating the Axon 7 from Android Marshmallow to Nougat in time for Google&#8217;s DayDream VR, because the Axon 7 is the first phone that was built with Google&#8217;s new standards in mind.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Axon 7&#8217;s 3,140mAh battery should last you a day, and ZTE has gotten rid of the dual-camera setup from the Pro and replaced it with a 21-megapixel rear camera and an 8-megapixel selfie cam.

Picking a smartphone operating system is a huge deal. You\\u2019re buying into an entire ecosystem of apps and compatible products when you choose between Android and iOS.<\\/p>\\n<p>Apple&#8217;s iOS is a beautiful, simple operating system and the App Store offers the best app selection imaginable. Each and every aspect of iOS is curated by Apple, and it shows. Android is more open and it has less rules, but that means that manufacturers and app makers can willfully ignore Google&#8217;s Material Design language and do whatever they want, sometimes rendering Android unrecognizable and ugly. Pure Android is gorgeous, but you don&#8217;t often see it. Only Google\\u2019s Pixel and Nexus phones run a pure version of the operating system. iOS is always beautiful and a pleasure to use on every iPhone because Apple has complete control over the OS.<\\/p>\\n<p>Since Apple is the only company that makes iPhones, it also has complete control over software updates. As such, iPhone users always get the most recent and best iOS experience possible. The vast majority of iPhone users are already on iOS 9, and nearly 15 percent immediately updated to iOS 10 just one day after its launch. If history is any indication, the remaining 75 percent of iOS users will soon follow and download iOS 10 in the coming weeks and months. Currently, there are nearly more users on iOS 10, which was just released in mid-September than there are people on last year&#8217;s version of Android, 6.0 Marshmallow, which launched in October 2015. And at this point, the percentage of users on the just released Android 7.0 Nougat is negligible, and it&#8217;s been out since the end of August.<\\/p>\\n<p>Android users don&#8217;t have that luxury. Unless you own a Pixel or Nexus device &#8212; and very few of Android users do &#8212; you will have to wait months if not years to get software updates. That&#8217;s why a mere 18.7 percent of Android users are currently running last year&#8217;s version of the OS on their phones. In fact, there are more Android users running KitKat, which is from 2013, than there are users running last year&#8217;s version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. It&#8217;s absurd.<\\/p>\\n<p>Software updates contain security updates, which keep your phone safe from malware, viruses, and hackers. Android is the most heavily targeted mobile OS, so it is attacked by the worst bugs, like Stagefright and Heartbleed, both of which remain unpatched for millions of Android users. Google now issues a security patch every month, but many manufacturers don&#8217;t push them to users in a timely fashion, if ever.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\"text-align: left;\\">In contrast, Apple can immediately patch security flaws and send the updated software to all iPhone users immediately. Since most users update their software when prompted, most iOS users are protected from these very real threats. There is no denying that iPhone users are safer. Apple&#8217;s iOS also offers full encryption with no compromises. The company even went to war with the U.S. government and the FBI to guarantee the right to encryption for its users.

Wired UK Now that we have been hands-on with the Marshall London at IFA in Berlin, we are not only intrigued -- we\'re impressed. All in all, this is a classy device with some unique features up its smart leather sleeves. If you\'re an audiophile, you\'ll no doubt want to test out its musical prowess before you invest, but rest assured that -- like the best music -- this phone is very easy to like. Engadget When you buy a car, some will go for value, or practicality; others will say "screw it" and buy what makes them feel good. And that\'s what the London is: It\'s singing along to "Bohemian Rhapsody" at the top of your voice in your (original) Mini convertible. Because why the hell not? Cnet If you\'re an audiophile, the news of Marshall\'s debut smartphone may be music to your ears. The audio and sound company, which specializes in making amplifiers, speakers and headphones launched a smartphone today called the London TWO SPEAKERS ARE LOUDER THAN ONE Marshall London might just be the loudest mobile phone on Earth. With two front-facing speakers, you can enjoy your music without the use of headphones. Perfect for those impromptu get-togethers. It s also pretty handy when you need to make a group phone call. Did we mention it s loud? M-BUTTON At the heart of the London is the M-Button a dedicated one-click access to your music, whatever the source of it may be. Thanks to this ingenious bit of engineering, you can control your music on top of whatever else you happen to have onyour screen. SCROLL WHEEL The scroll wheel gives you quick access to volume control. Its tactile precision allows you to find that sweet spot of sonic goodness. LIFE IN STEREO London is equipped with not one, but two stereo jacks allowing you and a friend to plug in and share your music or watch a video together. Each sound source has independent volume control, so you re free to kick out the jams while your friend keeps things mellow yellow. It\'s all about Sound Quality ALL ABOUT THE SOUND Marshall London packs a lot of heat under the hood; take for example the Cirrus Logic WM8281 Audio Hub. This smart codec gives the London a separate processor for music, allowing it to play at a higher resolution. Higher resolution means that even the best quality MP3 will sound phenomenally better when played with London. Additionally it lets you play uncompressed music such as FLAC format. This cannot be emphasized enough; the London is boss! MODE IN EARS INCLUDED What s the point in having a great music player if your headphones aren t up to the challenge? London comes with the highly rated Marshall Mode in-ear headphones so you can really experience London s mind-blowing sound. GLOBAL EQUALIZER One equalizer to rule them all! Use one of the pre-loaded profiles or adjust the sound to your liking and save it as a custom profile. The Global Equalizer will apply your selected profile to whichever music player you use. Accessing the equalizer is quick via the M-Button. BLUETOOTH APTX Bluetooth aptX delivers real-time high quality stereo audio over a Bluetooth connection. Design It\'s all in the details Feature 1: Headphones Included Mode Headphones included Feature 2: The M Button A dedicated one-click access to your music, whatever the source of it may be. Feature 3: Scroll Wheel tactile precision allows you to find that sweet spot of sonic goodness. (function(exports, doc) { doc.observe(\'dom:loaded\', function() { exports.slider10 = new }); })(window, document); Good looks run in the family. London has the same DNA as the rest of the Marshall lineup, which has stood the test of time for over 50 years. A matte black surface, similar to the skin of Marshall amps, offers better grip in your hands. Brass details are found on the scroll wheel, M-Button and both stereo jacks. It s a thing of beauty.

The audio and sound company, which specializes in making amplifiers, speakers and headphones launched a smartphone today called the London Be Creative Inspiration often strikes us when we re out and about, which is why London comes with a few nifty tools to help you seize the moment. DJ-App Some may argue that DJs are the rock stars of the current generation of music lovers. While that remains to be seen, Marshall couldn t ignore the fact that DJing is a popular way to enjoy music and connect with others. This is why London comes with a DJ app pre-installed. Connect your headphones and sound system into the two stereo jacks, launch the app and that s it. *DJApp launch late 2015. Microphones London comes equipped with dual microphones that are perfect for laying down a few spur of the moment riffs - all recorded in glorious stereo. Noise reduction means you ll be able to easily hear your tracks, even if you re recording outside. Marshall s sound engineers were blown away when this mic was tested, and we think you will be as well. Loopstack Pre-installed on London is the well-known AndroidTM app, LoopStack. LoopStack is a 4-channel recorder that allows you to record four tracks independently. LoopStack offers high quality 44KHz 16bit recording and processing. For more information, please click here.

This phone SHOULD be awesome...and for the most part; it is. It looks and feels great. However, bugs in the Equaliser+ music software\'s library (inc. the inability to delete tracks!) means this app is all but unusable and results in the need for a 3rd party music app. Despite promises from both Marshall and DJiT (the creators of Equaliser+); system and software updates are rare and this app still has the same bugs it had upon its release. Such a pity as this is otherwise my perfect phone. Muro January 19, 2017 Amazing audio Nice phone with amazing audio. If a second version is made some day, more horsepower, more storage, better camera and NFC would be nice. dalnetfia December 9, 2016 Must buy ! I think most cool phone on earth. I want buy this. Louder speakers, double aux, awesome ! Bjc76 November 29, 2016 Awesome looking product. This phone needs to come to Australia! Duke Wes November 15, 2016 More smartphones please!! To be honest for the specs only, I\'ll give it a 2 star. For the design and looks, I\'ll give it to the max, 5 star. But for now, I\'ll just give a 4 star. Please bring more smartphones (with the current trends\' specs. I\'ll definitely buy it without hesitation. Wilf EngineRoomoftheApocalypse October 27, 2016 Unusual and so very Marshall Took a little getting used to after a string of iPhones but now that I have it\'s brilliant and very unusual. lav Karlson September 13, 2016 Best Phone ever The best phone ever, best speakers and a very good battery. congrats to you ZoundIndustries. psikotik13 September 11, 2016 Back in love with my London I\'ve fallen back in love with my London. I had lot\'s of problems with Bluetooth play back skipping like a bad vinyl. But not with wired. But the level with wired was considerably lower than BT. But since buying a speaker with ATPX I\'ve had no problems. It sounds Awsome. But I complained a few times to Marshall about this and no response.

By Fran Berkman2012-10-15 17:29:56 UTC Human intelligence has a long and illustrious history. From Greek philosophers to geek programmers, being called a "smart" person is, and always has been, a weighty commendation. With such high inherent value placed on intelligence, bestowing telecommunications devices with the personified moniker "smartphones" means those devices better be pretty revolutionary and boy, are they ever. After being introduced in the late 1990s, smartphones have come to define the way individual people connect to the rest of the world. The top five manufacturers shipped nearly half a billion devices around the world in 2011 alone. About half of the mobile phones used in the U.S. are "smart," and that percentage is growing rapidly, according to Nielsen data released in March. Smartphones have come a long way in a short time. Improvements in technical specifications such as internal processors, battery life, storage capability, screen size and broadband connectivity optimize the way devices perform. While the future for smartphones looks promising, let\'s take a look at how we got to this point in time. The History of Smartphones 1946: AT&T Establishes the First Mobile Network Without a wireless network, there would not be wireless phones. Long before the Verizon guys were traveling the globe asking "Can you hear me now?" the American Telephone and Telegraph Company set up the first wireless network. On June 17, 1946, a truck driver placed the first wireless telephone call. 1974: Theodore George Paraskevakos Patents the Basic Smartphone Concept Years ahead of his time, Paraskevakos filed the paperwork to the U.S. Patent Office in 1972 for an "apparatus for generating and transmitting digital information." Paraskevakos was born in Athens, Greece, but became a citizen of the U.S. His company, based in Delaware, was ultimately granted the patent in May 1974. 1994: IBM Combines a Cellphone and PDA Forming the Simon Personal Communicator This ancestor of the modern smartphone was capable of text messaging, faxing and emailing, in addition to making phone calls. The device retailed for $1,099, or $899 if the buyer signed up for a two-year service contract (some things never change). 1999: The Smartphone Market Begins to Bear Fruit With the BlackBerry Email Device At $399, the initial BlackBerry device was certainly more affordable than the Simon Personal Communicator. The only problem was the first BlackBerry was only a two-way pager with email capabilities, not a phone. It wasn\'t until 2003 that a BlackBerry smartphone hit the market. 2000: Ericsson Uses the Magic Word When Marketing Its R380 Give Ericsson credit for marketing prowess. The Swedish company called its R380 mobile phone a "smartphone," a term that has certainly caught on in the marketplace. The device was a lightweight flip phone that ran the Symbian operating system. Symbian was the dominant smartphone operating system until Android surpassed it in 2011. 2007: Apple\'s Multi-Touch Screen iPhone Brings Smartphone Design to New Heights It was kind of like an iPod, except you could use it to make phone calls, take pictures and browse the Internet. Apple was not exactly a pioneering smartphone company. The iPhone was released years after the first smartphone, and despite Apple\'s claim, it wasn\'t the first company to have a multi-touch screen. By combining the features, however, Apple created a smartphone that offered more than just a way to communicate with other people. The iPhone was literally a mobile media center. Updated versions of the iPhone have become progressively more sophisticated, and fanfare for the product seems to increase with each release. Apple introduced the most recent incarnation of the device, the iPhone 5, at a ballyhooed press event on Sept. 12. SEE ALSO: Apple Unveils iPhone 5, Finally 2008: Google Blows Up the Smartphone Market With Its Android Operating System Android phones hit the market in October 2008, and it quickly became the dominant mobile operating system. There were more Android devices sold than Apple and Symbian combined in 2010. Although Android and Apple\'s iOS are rivals, there is not actually one "Android phone," but rather a multitude of models across several companies that make Android-based phones. Today, there are more than 500 million active Android devices, which is about one for every 14 people on the planet. Hopefully they\'re not all as paranoid as this little guy: 2010: The Smartphone Market Catches a Virus Smartphones have become so integrated that people are pushing all kinds of highly personal information through the devices, such as email passwords and bank account information. This is exactly the type of information cyber criminals want to steal. Not to mention, with people freely and frequently installing third-party software onto their smartphones, there is significant potential for security problems. Kaspersky Lab, a mobile-security software developer, identified what it said was the first Trojan virus for Android devices in 2010. Keeping your phone\'s operating system up to date should help protect against these mobile monsters. The Future of Smartphones Security concerns aside, the ability to support third-party software will be the driving force behind smartphone performance going forward. Third-party software refers to the features we tenderly refer to as "apps." With apps, smartphones\' capabilities are not limited to the ideas of the programmers at the companies that manufacture the hardware such as Apple or Samsung. Anyone with an idea can create a smartphone app. Many of these simple yet subtly life-changing apps, such as Instagram and Shazam, have even been incorporated into our vernacular and used as verbs, just like Google. In its four year existence, the Apple App Store already boasts 700,000 mobile apps with downloads totaling more than 25 billion. Google Play hosts 600,000 apps and sees 1.5 billion app downloads every month. With motivated startups driving the mobile app development industry, the only restriction on smartphone capabilities is the limit of human imagination and, of course, current hardware. In other words, if there isn\'t yet "an app for that," there probably will be one soon.
